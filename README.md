This is my version of the Google homepage.

I created the top row first as two separate groupings that float left and right, respectively. I then added the image, text input, and search buttons, centering them and sizing them as best I could looking at the homepage for input. I then added a bottom row, also using the float property.

I then got to styling, beyond just sizing the input field and buttons. I got my colors using developer tools to look at the homepage, and had to google a lot that I just couldn't figure out. I also learned a few things from actual student submissions, such as the focus-within property used to keep the search border's shadow when the text box is in use.

It is far from fully functional, the search bar doesn't work, the mic is just a link back to the same page, and I still cannot figure out for the life of me how to both have a bar at the bottom and keep that element from being affected in one way or another by resizing the window. Both position:absolute and position:fixed have their issues, but I have chosen to use position:fixed.

Even wrapping everything in a div doesn't stop that from happening.
